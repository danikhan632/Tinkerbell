Example: Async Training with Alpaca Dataset

This example demonstrates training on real instruction-following data from
the Alpaca dataset. The model learns to generate responses based on
instructions (without seeing the completions during training).

Performance gain: ~3-5x faster than sync for batch training!

✓ Successfully trained LoRA adapter on {len(ALPACA_SAMPLES)} Alpaca samples
✓ Model ID: {model_id}
✓ Total time: {elapsed:.2f}s
✓ Async API enables parallel processing for maximum throughput

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
1. Async endpoints return futures immediately (non-blocking)
2. Submit all requests first, then retrieve results
3. This maximizes GPU utilization for batch training
4. Real-world speedup: ~3-5x vs sequential sync training

NEXT STEPS:
- Use /api/v1/sample or /api/v1/asample to test the trained adapter
- Try custom loss functions with loss_fn parameter
- Scale to larger datasets with the same async pattern
